## 💻 What Are GTA 5 Cheats?

**GTA 5 cheats** are built-in codes, external trainers, and modded menus that give you full access to abilities, weapons, vehicles, and world manipulation. On PC, you’ve got three main ways to cheat:

* 🔠 **Built-in console codes** (type into the in-game command box)
* 🧩 **Trainer software** (run alongside the game for real-time hacks)
* 🎛️ **Mod menus** (overlay UI with god-level control)

All of them are meant for **story mode only**, and give you tools to explore, fight, and experiment however you want—with zero consequences.
